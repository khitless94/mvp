# Supabase Waitlist Setup Guide

## Database Table Structure

The `waitlist` table is already configured in your Supabase database with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE waitlist (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  country TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_number TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add unique constraint on email to prevent duplicates
ALTER TABLE waitlist ADD CONSTRAINT waitlist_email_unique UNIQUE (email);

-- Add index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_created_at ON waitlist(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_country ON waitlist(country);
```

## Row Level Security (RLS)

To secure your waitlist table, you should enable RLS and create appropriate policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE waitlist ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anonymous users to insert (for waitlist signup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert" ON waitlist
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to read their own data
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read own" ON waitlist
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
```

## Viewing Waitlist Data

To view the waitlist data in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Table Editor" in the sidebar
3. Select the "waitlist" table
4. You'll see all the signups with their details

### SQL Queries for Analysis

```sql
-- Count total signups
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_signups FROM waitlist;

-- Count signups by country
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as signups 
FROM waitlist 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY signups DESC;

-- Recent signups (last 7 days)
SELECT name, email, country, created_at 
FROM waitlist 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Daily signup trends
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as signup_date,
  COUNT(*) as daily_signups
FROM waitlist 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```
